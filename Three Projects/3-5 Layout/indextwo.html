    <h1>GETTING OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE</h1>
    <p>"While despite not being very involved in high school, I still managed to form a tight niche of friends;<br>but I still yearned to belong to a group that made me feel bigger than myself.<br></p>
    <p>
    Unfortunately, I consider myself virtually talentless — I can’t sing, I have two left feet, and I am pretty<br> much the most uncoordinated person you will ever meet. So if I wasn’t in school, I was found working<br> part time at Rite Aid. Once I graduated, I made a promise to myself that college was going to be<br> different — I would do more than just work, go to class, hang out with my friends, and watch Netflix."<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    During my freshman orientation, they mentioned an Activities and Involvement Fair where student<br> clubs and organizations would be highlighting what they were about. I was so excited! This was the<br> perfect opportunity for me to keep my promise — and a few days later, that’s exactly what I did.
