        <h2>What is fitbit?</h2>
        <p> Fitbit was founded in 2007 by James Park and Eric Friedman. Since the launch of the high-tech<br>fitness band in 2011, over 21 million devices have been sold. The band has many features including step<br> counts, calories burned and flights climbed. The band has an app that goes with it that can sync up to<br>a mobile device, which will record all the data while the band is being worn. As the popularity of the<br> active bands went up, the company started to release different models of the FitBit. Fitbit Flex and<br>FitBit Charge. Many people compare the FitBit to the Apple Watch. Although both fitness tools can<br>do essentially the same thing, studies show that many people prefer the Apple Watch over the FitBit.<br>There are several pro’s and con’s when thinking about buying a FitBit.

        <p>
          Fitbit only started to recieve positive recognition in 2009, people started to realize the pros of having a<br>fitbit and started paying more attention to it. A lot of people decided to try it out for themselves. The founder<br>of fitbit first raised $400,000 to start up the company from the ground up to realize it<br>wasnt enough. He then decided to attract investors to raise money for the company. People gave in<br>and started investing, before they knew it fitbit blew up. Nobody ever invented a product like this<br>one and that is the reason why it started getting so much recognition.

          <h2> Pros: </h2>
          <ul>
            <li> It is a great motivator, once you set a goal you are determined to achieve it until you get there. If you have not reached your goal by nighttime, you will have take the extra mile to reach your goal.
            </li>

            </li>
            <li> It can track how many steps you take in a day, how many miles you walk or run, the food you eat and how many calories they have, and it also measures your blood pressure.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2> Cons: </h2>

            </li>
            <li> Not fully accurate when tracking the steps taken in a day.
            </li>
            <li> Very over priced due the lack of feautures it comes with compared to the apple watch such as texting and talking on the phone.

              <h2>Why Fitbit?</h2>
              <p>Fitbit, apple watch, android wears are very unique watches. They all have very different styles, although the<br>most known is Apple watch, people buy Fitbits at a rapid rate due to the fact that it might look<br>better. Most of us might end up purchasing an apple watch due to the fact that it’s an apple product<br>and because most of us have IPhones so that explains why more than one of your friends or relative<br>might buy an apple watch before they even look at a Fitbit. Some people have android cell phones and will<br>buy an android wear such as a Samsung brand. Out of the three main brands most might prefer an<br>apple watch, but if you look down below it will convince you to choose a Fitbit instead. It’s cheaper, and<br>it does the same things the other two watches offer if not more.
